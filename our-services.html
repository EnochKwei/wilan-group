          <p class="services-title">Visual Inspections</p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            Visual inspections are one of our more important, pre-work services as this allows for us to inspect, via a combination of pictures and a drawn-out plan of defects when relating to any construction works that
            might be required during any maintenance period on any structure.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            Advantages to using visual inspections, is that it allows us to properly determine where the defects lie and allow accurate quoting for only that which requires attentions, thereby saving money on the clientsâ€™ behalf as well as providing
            visual logs of the current state of the structure.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            All visual photographs are taken with a high-resolution camera as to provide the best quality when handed over to the client for inspection of severity.<br>
            Visual inspections can also be carried out on work that has been recently completed, yet out of sight from the client.<br>
            This will help the client to be able to approve that the work was completed to his specifications and to allow the client the ease of mind that the work carried out was done in a professional manner.

          <p class="services-title">NDT Inspections</p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            Wilan Oil Field Services offers many variations of NDT inspections, which is imperative in gaining knowledge into the structural integrity of any metal structure, should it be a weld joint, boiler tank, structural support beams or any
            other load bearing metal structures which are of high importance to your facility.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            All employees sent for NDT inspections are qualified and certified in their specific areas of expertise.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            The varieties of NDT Inspections we offer are:<br>
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="services-list" style="font-weight: bold;">MPI (Magnetic Particle Inspection):</li>
            <p class="our-services-text">This inspection method is used to detect surface and subsurface discontinuities in ferroelectric metals. The reason for ferroelectric metals is this method uses a yoke which induces an electromagnetic current
              through the substrate and if it is non-conductible, then false results will be given.
            </p>
            <li class="services-list" style="font-weight: bold;">Dye Penetration Inspection: </li>
            <p class="our-services-text">This is a widely applied and low-cost inspection method used to locate surface-breaking defects in all non-porous materials (metals, plastics, or ceramics). The penetrant may be applied to all non-ferrous
              materials and ferrous materials, although for ferrous components magnetic- particle inspection is often used instead for its subsurface detection capability. LPI is used to detect casting, forging and welding surface defects such as
              hairline cracks, surface porosity, leaks in new products, and fatigue cracks on in-service components.
            </p>
            <li class="services-list" style="font-weight: bold;">Ultra-Sonic Testing:</li>
            <p class="our-services-text">
              This is widely used when doing thickness gauging on any high priority structures to test for corrosion, for example: testing corrosion on pipe work. It can also be used to test for internal defects within metals or to determine the
              characteristics of a metal.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            All these methods above are important, especially when maintenance work, such as grinding, or welding is done on high priority structures. Advantages to using NDT are that you can be assured that any work carried out will be flawless and
            that the maintenance procedure has been completed successfully.

          <p class="our-services-text">
            Wilan Oil Field Services prides itself in offering highly skilled workers knowledgeable in the coatings industry. All coating/painting jobs are followed through using industry standard techniques, which involve
            cleaning the surface, either by chemicals, high pressure washing or by grit blasting and then primed to ensure that the surface will be properly prepared to receive its coat and to ensure longevity of the coating itself. Specifications
            for when the coating is applied, is supplied by a reputable coatings supplier and once completed will be inspected to ensure that it has been completed successfully.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            During the coating and preparation process, all precautions are taking to prevent spills and/or mess to adhere to any environmental requirements the clients might have. Any additional requirements by the client will be provided for
            before commencement of any work.

          <p class="services-title">Corrosion Prevention and Repairs</p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            As in most industries, corrosion plays an impossible task when it comes to maintaining the structural integrity of high priority structures. In order to combat corrosion, one needs to know what is causing the corrosion in the first
            place, so that the correct method can be applied to ensure structural longevity. Our skilled workforce will inspect the structure and in conjunction with a coatings company, the most suitable product will be selected for application.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            Once corrosion has occurred, the general scope will be to remove the rust either by a grinding or by using a wire brush, all depending on whether the surrounding environment allows for grinding. Once the rust has been removed, coating
            will be applied, and the specifications of the coatings will be supplied either by the client or the coatings company.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            In cases where rust has occurred on high priority structures, NDT testing can be carried out prior to coating, using Ultra-Sonic Testing to test the thickness of the method and determine whether it's safe to stay in operation, which will
            be determined by an engineer. Ultra-Sonic Testing can also be used to gauge the thickness of the coating to ensure that the specific guidelines set out have been followed. All these methods are offered to allow the client ease of mind in
            knowing that the work has been carried out successfully and to specifications.
          </p>
          <p class="our-services-text">
            Advantages of corrosion prevention and repairing are:

            <li class="services-list">Knowing that your structure is structurally sound and free of any corrosion.</li>
